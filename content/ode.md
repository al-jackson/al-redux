The Goblin.

<br />

"Crack a can with patent hiss, and bathe the goblin's teeth,

Enamel keys, in fizzy liquid, with which they touch-type favourites lists,

Head back, little finger, mouth 'doth grin' and dropped lids,

all dressed up in a super-tunic :0

of Phenylalanine, and a Sunset Yellow bib"

The Ogre.

<br />

“Coz I’m no longer feeding the ogre who will club my

grandchild’s bones, I did not google Gaelic or its genesis,

<br />

Instead I stared from inner rim of Pilsner,

at the sum of ten centuries - Celtic twins of seven foot,

Goading with creche-glee my lordly lineage

and its murky constitution,

<br />

They understood I colonised them,

and thru some devilry forced them,

from before my natal day,

to promenade over white hot lumps of coal,

they hoiked to Tyneside on indentured backs (*in a way),

<br />

So us oppressors clustered,

Into choad crystals, formed from Pilsner, white wine, Whiskey ‘Mac’,

And thru eye contact (daggered at the Gemini)

Understood they’d hand ours back to us,

If re-permitted dunking or the rack"
