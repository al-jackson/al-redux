“Coz I’m no longer feeding the ogre who will club my

granchild’s bones, I did not google Gaelic or its genesis,



Rather, I looked up from inner rim of Pilsner,

at the sum of ten centuries - Celtic twins of seven foot,

Goading, with glee of the creche, my lordly lineage

and its murky constitution,



They understood I colonised them,

and thru some devilry forced them,

from before my natal day,

to promenade over white hot lumps of coal,

they hoiked to Tyneside on indentured backs (*in a way),



So us oppressors clustered,

Into choad crystals, formed from Pilsner, white wine, Whiskey ‘Mac’,

And thru eye contact (daggered at the Gemini)

Understood they’d hand ours back to us,

If re-permitted dunking or the rack
